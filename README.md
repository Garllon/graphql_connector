An easy connector to call your `graphql` server. Currently there is no schema
check in the code, but i will add it.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'graphql_connector'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install graphql_connector

## Usage

You need to configure the `graphql_connector` first:
``` ruby
GraphqlConnector.configure do |config|
  config.add_server(name: 'Foo', uri: 'http://foo.com/api/graphql', headers: {})
end

For each graphql server you wish to query use `add_server`.
```

### raw_query

Then you can call your graphql_endpoint:
```ruby
GraphqlConnector::<name>.raw_query(query_string)
```

Note that `<name>` has to be replaced by any of the ones added via `add_server`

### query

You can also use the more comfortable `query`:
```ruby
GraphqlConnector::<name>.query(model, condition, selected_fields)
```

| Variable        | DataType                | Example                                 |
|----------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| model           | String                  | 'product'                               |
| condition       | Hash(key, value)        | { id: 1 }                               |
| selected_fields | Array of Strings/Hashes | ['id', 'name', productCategory: ['id']] |

> Caution:
> You get an OpenStruct back. Currently only the first level attributes are
> supported with OpenStruct, associated objects are still a normal array of
> hashes.

#### selected_fields

The syntax for the associations looks like the following:
```
['<attribute_name>', <association_name>: ['<attribute_name_of_the_association>']]
```

Example:
```ruby
['id', 'name', productCategory: ['id', 'name']]
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run
```shell
bundle install
```

Then, run
```shell
bundle exec rspec spec
```
to run the tests.
You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
